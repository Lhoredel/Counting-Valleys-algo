# Counting-Valleys-algo
This code solves the Counting Valleys problem by tracking a hiker's elevation changes to count how many valleys they traverse during their hike. The code monitors the current elevation level and increments the valley count each time the hiker returns to sea level (elevation 0) from below by taking an uphill step.
